# BruteSelection

#### About

This project aims to incorporate automation in the process of feature selection for machine learning models.
Think brute force password cracking but in the context of feature selection.

#### Current State
Alpha.

#### Future Improvements
* Parallel processing to improve compuational efficiency
* Stream-lining code
* More compartmentalization of functionality
    * allows for pipelining
    * pick and choose what functions to use
* model choice
* performance metric choice
